    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Summary</h1>
   <p> The applications, physics of the flow and heat transfer phenomena,
    available empirical correlations and values they predict, and numerical
    simulation techniques and results of impinging jet devices for heat transfer
    are described. The relative strengths and drawbacks of the k–e, k–o,
    Reynolds stress model, algebraic stress models, shear stress transport, and
    v
    2
    f turbulence models for impinging jet flow and heat transfer are compared.
    Select model equations are provided as well as quantitative assessments of
    model errors and judgments of model suitability.</p> </br> </br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Conclusions</h1>

    <p> review of recent impinging jet research publications identified a series
    of engineering research tasks important to improving the design and
    resulting performance of impinging jets:</p></br>
    
    <ol>
        <li>    <p>Clearly resolve the physical mechanisms by which multiple peaks

            occur in the transfer coefficient profiles, and clarify which mechan-
            ism(s) dominate in various geometries and Reynolds number regimes.</p></li>
        <li>
            <p>Develop a turbulence model, and associated wall treatment if
                necessary, that reliably and efficiently provides time-averaged
                transfer coefficients. Given the varied and inaccurate results of the
                alternatives, the SST and v
                2
                –f models offer the best results for the
                least amount of computation time. Even so, they are imperfect. The
                improved turbulence model must correctly predict the jet spreading,
                turbulent flow effects in the stagnation region, and turbulent flow
                properties along the wall. Though inelegant, the solution by means
                of a hybrid model would serve this purpose if it included a
                turbulence model carefully adjusted to properly simulate the turning
                anisotropic flow field in the stagnation region.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            Develop alternate nozzle and installation geometries that provide
            higher efficiency, meaning improved Nu profiles at either a set flow
        
            or set blower power. Present work in swirling jets, pulsed jets, cross-
            shaped nozzles, tab nozzles, coaxial nozzles, and other geometries
        
            represent a small sample of the practical possibilities. In addition to
            simply raising the average Nu value, it is of practical use to design
            and test hardware to produce more uniform Nu patterns.

        <li> <p>Further explore the effects of jet interference in jet array geometries,
            both experimentally and numerically. This includes improved design
            of exit pathways for spent flow in array installations.</p>
